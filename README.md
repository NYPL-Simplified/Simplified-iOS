# Building With Adobe DRM

01. `git clone https://github.com/NYPL/Simplified-iOS.git` or `git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git`
02. `cd Simplified-iOS`
03. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
04. Install [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) if you haven't already.
05. `pod install`
06. Symlink the "DRM_Connector_Prerelease" directory to "adobe-rmsdk" within the "Simplified-iOS" directory. (You will need to have obtained the Adobe DRM Connector prerelease from Adobe.)
07. Follow the instructions in "adobe-rmsdk/RMSDK_User_Manual(obj).pdf" to build OpenSSL (section 12.1) and cURL (section 12.3).*
08. `sh adobe-rmsdk-build.sh`
09. `cp APIKeys.swift.example Simplified/APIKeys.swift` and edit accordingly.
10. `open Simplified.xcworkspace`
11. Build.

\* If you want to release your app in Apple's App Store, you must add `--enable-ipv6` to line 80 of Adobe's "build.sh" script used for building cURL. Without that flag, cURL will not provide proper support for IPv6 and therefore Apple will reject your application.

# Building Without DRM

**Note:** This configuration is not currently supported. In the interim, you _should_ be able to get it to build via the following steps:

01. `git clone https://github.com/NYPL/Simplified-iOS.git` or `git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git`
02. `cd Simplified-iOS`
03. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
04. Install [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) if you haven't already.
05. `pod install`
06. `rm -rf adept-ios adobe-content-filter`
07. `cp APIKeys.swift.example Simplified/APIKeys.swift` and edit accordingly.
08. `open Simplified.xcworkspace`
09. Comment out the last line of "Simplified.xcconfig" that sets `FEATURE_DRM_CONNECTOR=1`.
10. Delete "libAdept.a" and "libAdobe Content Filter.a" from "Link Binary with Libraries" for the "SimplyE" target.
11. Build.

# Contributing

This codebase follows [Google's Objective-C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml)
including the use of two-space indentation. Both Objective-C and Swift may be
used for new code.

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `NYPLAccount`
* `NYPLBookCoverRegistry` (used directly only by `NYPLBookRegistry`)
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLConfiguration`
* `NYPLKeychain`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`

All of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.

Questions and suggestions should be submitted as GitHub issues and tagged with
the appropriate labels. More in-depth discussion occurs via Slack: Email
`jamesenglish@nypl.org` for access.
