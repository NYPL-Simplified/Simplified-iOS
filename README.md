# System Requirements

- Install Xcode 11.5 in `/Applications`, open it and make sure to install additional components if it asks you.
- Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already. Using `brew` is recommended.

# Building without Adobe DRM nor Private Repos

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git
cd Simplified-iOS
git checkout develop

# one-time set-up
./scripts/setup-repo-nodrm.sh

# idempotent script to rebuild all dependencies
./scripts/build-3rd-party-dependencies.sh --no-private
```

Open `Simplified.xcodeproj` and build the `SimplyE-noDRM` target.


# Building With Adobe DRM

## Building the Application

01. Contact project lead and ensure you have access to all required submodules and other repos, including private ones.
02. Then simply run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git
cd Simplified-iOS
./scripts/bootstrap-drm.sh
```
03. Open Simplified.xcodeproj and build the `SimplyE` or `Open eBooks` target.


## Building Dependencies Individually

The `scripts` directory contains a number of scripts to build dependencies and perform other build/setup tasks, such as archiving and exporting. All these scripts must be run from the root of the Simplified-iOS repo, not from the `scripts` directory.

To build all Carthage dependencies from scratch you can use the `build-carthage.sh` script. Note that this will wipe the Carthage folder if you already have it:
```bash
./scripts/build-carthage.sh
```
To run a `carthage update`, use the `update-carthage.sh` script. As the previous script, this also rebuilds the Carthage dependencies from scratch:
```bash
./scripts/update-carthage.sh
```
To build DRM-related dependencies, you can use the `adobe-rmsdk-build.sh` or `/build-openssl-curl.sh` scripts.

# Building Secondary Targets

The Xcode project contains 3 additional targets beside the main one referenced earlier:

- **SimplyECardCreator**: This is a convenience target to use when making changes to the [CardCreator-iOS](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/CardCreator-iOS) framework. It takes the framework out of the normal Carthage build to instead build it directly via Xcode. Use this in conjunction with the `SimplifiedCardCreator` workspace. It requires DRM.
- **Open eBooks**: This is an app primarily targeted toward the education space. It requires DRM.

# Contributing

This codebase follows Google's  [Swift](https://google.github.io/swift/) and [Objective-C](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml) style guides,
including the use of two-space indentation. More details are available in [our wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Mobile-client-applications#code-style-1).

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `AccountsManager`
* `NYPLUserAccount`
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLKeychain`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`
* `NYPLMigrationManager`
* `NYPLSettings`
* `NYPLSettingsNYPLProblemDocumentCacheManager`

Most of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.
