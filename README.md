# System Requirements

- Install the latest Xcode in `/Applications`, open it and make sure to install additional components if it asks you.
- Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already. Using `brew` is recommended.

# Building With Adobe DRM

## Building the Application

01. Contact project lead and ensure you have repo access to all required submodules, including private ones. Also request a copy of the Adobe RMSDK archive, which is currently not on Github, unzip it and place it in a place of your choice.
02. Then run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Certificates.git
cd Simplified-iOS
ln -s <rmsdk_path>/DRM_Connector_Prerelease adobe-rmsdk
git checkout develop
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
03. Build dependencies (carthage, OpenSSL, cURL). You can also use this script at any other time if you ever need to rebuild them: it should be idempotent. The non-optional parameter specifies which configuration of the AudioEngine framework to use. Note that the Release build of AudioEngine does not contain slices for Simulator architectures, causing a Carthage build failure.
```bash
./build-3rd-parties-dependencies.sh <Debug | Release>
```
04. Generate NYPLSecrets.swift from Simplified-iOS folder. Executing the script without argument will generate the .swift file in /Simplified-iOS/Simplified/.
```bash
swift ../Certificates/SimplyE/iOS/KeyObfuscator.swift
```
 You can also add an output path as the argument.
 ```bash
 swift ../Certificates/SimplyE/iOS/KeyObfuscator.swift /Simplified/Utilities/
 ```

05. Open Simplified.xcodeproj and Build!


## Building Dependencies Individually

To build all Carthage dependencies from scratch you can use the following script. Note that this will wipe the Carthage folder if you already have it:
```bash
./build-carthage.sh <Debug | Release>
```
To run a `carthage update`, use the following script to avoid AudioEngine errors. Note, this will rebuild all Carthage dependencies:
```bash
./carthage-update-simplye.sh <Debug | Release>
```
To build OpenSSL and cURL from scratch, you can use the following script:
```bash
./build-openssl-curl.sh
```
Both scripts must be run from the Simplified-iOS repo root.

# Building Without Adobe DRM

**Note:** This configuration is not currently supported. In the interim, you _should_ be able to get it to build via the following steps:

01. `git clone https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git` or `git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git`
02. `cd Simplified-iOS`
03. `git submodule deinit adept-ios && git rm -rf adept-ios`
04. `git submodule deinit adobe-content-filter && git rm -rf adobe-content-filter`
05. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
06. Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already.
07. Remove "NYPL-Simplified/NYPLAEToolkit" and "AudioEngine.json" in `Cartfile` and `Cartfile.resolved`.
08. `carthage bootstrap --platform ios --use-ssh`
09. `cp APIKeys.swift.example Simplified/APIKeys.swift` and edit accordingly.
10. `cp Accounts.json.example Simplified/Accounts.json`.
11. `(cd readium-sdk; sh MakeHeaders.sh Apple)` (parentheses included) to generate the headers for Readium.
12. `open Simplified.xcodeproj`
13. Remove import of "Simplified+RMSDK.xcconfig" from "Simplified.xcconfig".
14. Delete `NYPLAEToolkit.framework` and `AudioEngine.framework` from "Link Binary with Libraries", and remove input and output filepaths for `AudioEngine.framework` and `NYPLAEToolkit.framework` from `Copy Frameworks (Carthage)`.
15. Note: For now, we recommend keeping any unstaged changes as a single git stash until better dynamic build support is added.
16. Build.

# Contributing

This codebase follows [Google's Objective-C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml)
including the use of two-space indentation. Both Objective-C and Swift may be
used for new code.

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `NYPLAccount`
* `NYPLBookCoverRegistry` (used directly only by `NYPLBookRegistry`)
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLConfiguration`
* `NYPLKeychain`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`
* `NYPLMigrationManager`

All of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.

Questions, suggestions, and general discussion occurs via Slack: Email
`swans062@umn.edu` for access.
