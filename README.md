# SimplyE and Open eBooks

This repo contains the client-side code for the New York Public Library's [SimplyE](https://www.nypl.org/books-music-movies/ebookcentral/simplye) and [Open eBooks](https://openebooks.net) apps.

The 2 apps share most of the code base. App-specific source files will have a `SE` / `OE` prefix or suffix, while configuration files reside under the `SimplyE` and `OpenEbooks` directories at the root of the repo. 

Consequently, [releases](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS/releases) in this repo track both apps. However, you won't see any Open eBooks versions before 1.9.0 because historically Open eBooks lived in a separate repo. Releases that lack an app specifier, i.e. any version before v3.6.2, are SimplyE releases.

# System Requirements

- Install Xcode 11.5 in `/Applications`, open it and make sure to install additional components if it asks you. (We have not upgraded to Xcode 12 yet because of issues related to Carthage.)
- Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already. Using `brew` is recommended.

# Building without Adobe DRM nor Private Repos

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git
cd Simplified-iOS
git checkout develop

# one-time set-up
./scripts/setup-repo-nodrm.sh

# idempotent script to rebuild all dependencies
./scripts/build-3rd-party-dependencies.sh --no-private
```

Open `Simplified.xcodeproj` and build the `SimplyE-noDRM` target.


# Building With Adobe DRM

## Building the Application from Scratch

01. Contact project lead and ensure you have access to all the required private repos.
02. Then simply run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git
cd Simplified-iOS
./scripts/bootstrap-drm.sh
```
03. Open Simplified.xcodeproj and build the `SimplyE` or `Open eBooks` targets.

## Building Dependencies Individually

After bootstrapping, it's unlikely you'll need to do that again, because the DRM dependencies very rarely change. 

More common is the case of needing to update/rebuild the 3rd party dependencies managed by Carthage. To that end (and more), the `scripts` directory contains a number of scripts to rebuild them and perform other build/setup tasks from the command line, such as archiving and exporting. All these scripts must be run from the root of the Simplified-iOS repo, not from the `scripts` directory.

For instance, to build all 3rd party dependencies minus DRM:
```bash
./scripts/build-3rd-party-dependencies.sh
```
In the rare event you need to build DRM-related dependencies, you can use the `adobe-rmsdk-build.sh` script.

# Building Secondary Targets

The Xcode project contains 2 additional targets beside the main one referenced earlier and the unit tests:

- **SimplyECardCreator**: This is a convenience target to use when making changes to the [CardCreator-iOS](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/CardCreator-iOS) framework. It takes the framework out of the normal Carthage build to instead build it directly via Xcode. Use this in conjunction with the `SimplifiedCardCreator` workspace. It requires DRM.
- **Open eBooks**: This is an app primarily targeted toward the education space. It requires DRM.

# Contributing

This codebase follows Google's [Swift](https://google.github.io/swift/) and [Objective-C](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml) style guides, including the use of two-space indentation. More details are available in [our wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Mobile-client-applications#code-style-1).

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `AccountsManager`
* `NYPLUserAccount`
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`
* `NYPLSettings`
* `NYPLKeychain`

Most of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.

Questions, suggestions, and general discussion occurs via Slack: Email
