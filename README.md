# System Requirements

- Install the latest Xcode (11.4 or higher) in `/Applications`, open it and make sure to install additional components if it asks you.
- Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already. Using `brew` is recommended.

# Building With Adobe DRM

## Building the Application

01. Contact project lead and ensure you have repo access to all required submodules, including private ones. Also request a copy of the Adobe RMSDK archive, which is currently not on Github, unzip it and place it in a place of your choice.
02. Then run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git
git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Certificates.git
cd Simplified-iOS
ln -s <rmsdk_path>/DRM_Connector_Prerelease adobe-rmsdk
git checkout develop
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
03. Build dependencies (carthage, OpenSSL, cURL). You can also use this script at any other time if you ever need to rebuild them: it should be idempotent. The non-optional parameter specifies which configuration of the AudioEngine framework to use. Note that the Release build of AudioEngine does not contain slices for Simulator architectures, causing a Carthage build failure.
```bash
./build-3rd-parties-dependencies.sh <Debug | Release>
```
04. Open Simplified.xcodeproj and build the SimplyE target.

## Building Dependencies Individually

To build all Carthage dependencies from scratch you can use the following script. Note that this will wipe the Carthage folder if you already have it:
```bash
./build-carthage.sh <Debug | Release>
```
To run a `carthage update`, use the following script to avoid AudioEngine errors. Note, this will rebuild all Carthage dependencies:
```bash
./carthage-update-simplye.sh <Debug | Release>
```
To build OpenSSL and cURL from scratch, you can use the following script:
```bash
./build-openssl-curl.sh
```
Both scripts must be run from the Simplified-iOS repo root.

# Building Without Adobe DRM

**Note:** This configuration is not currently supported. In the interim, you _should_ be able to get it to build via the following steps:

01. `git clone https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git` or `git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS.git`
02. `cd Simplified-iOS`
03. `git submodule deinit adept-ios && git rm -rf adept-ios`
04. `git submodule deinit adobe-content-filter && git rm -rf adobe-content-filter`
05. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
06. Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already.
07. Remove "NYPL-Simplified/NYPLAEToolkit" from `Cartfile` and `Cartfile.resolved`.
08. `carthage bootstrap --platform ios --use-ssh`
09. `cp APIKeys.swift.example Simplified/APIKeys.swift` and edit accordingly.
10. `cp Accounts.json.example Simplified/Accounts.json`.
11. `cp GoogleService-Info.plist.example GoogleService-Info.plist` and edit with you firebase project config.
12. `cp ReaderClientCert.sig.example Simplified/ReaderClientCert.sig` **Note:** This is skeleton only, contact project admins to obtain a copy of a real file.
13. `(cd readium-sdk; sh MakeHeaders.sh Apple)` (parentheses included) to generate the headers for Readium.
14. `open Simplified.xcodeproj`
15. Comment out/remove line with include of "Simplified+RMSDK.xcconfig" in "Simplified.xcconfig".
16. Remove `FEATURE_DRM_CONNECTOR` entries in _Build Settings_ -> _Swift Compiler - Custom Flags_ -> _Active Compilation Conditions_ in project settings
17. Delete `NYPLAEToolkit.framework`, `AudioEngine.framework`, `libADEPT.a` and `libAdobe Content Filter.a` from _General_ -> _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_ section in project settings.
18. Remove input and output filepaths for `AudioEngine.framework` and `NYPLAEToolkit.framework` from `Copy Frameworks (Carthage)` _Build Phase_ in project settings.
19. Note: For now, we recommend keeping any unstaged changes as a single git stash until better dynamic build support is added.
20. Build.

# Building for Readium 2 Integration

For working on integrating R2 into SimplyE, use the `feature/readium2` branch. First build the app following the steps above for building with/without DRM.

Then we recommend using the `SimplifiedR2.workspace`. This assumes you have checked out the following frameworks (clone them as siblings of `Simplified-iOS` on the file system):
```bash
cd Simplified-iOS/..
git clone https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/r2-shared-swift
git clone https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/r2-streamer-swift
git clone https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift
```
The first 2 repos contain patched versions of `R2Shared` and `R2Streamer` to enable Adobe DRM in Readium 2.

Build their own Carthage dependencies first:
```bash
cd r2-shared-swift
carthage checkout --use-ssh
carthage build --platform ios
cd ../r2-streamer-swift
carthage checkout --use-ssh
carthage build --platform ios
cd ../r2-navigator-swift
carthage checkout --use-ssh
carthage build --platform ios
```
Then finally build Carthage for SimplyE (for a faster build, you can remove the related R2 lines from SimplyE's Cartfile since the `SimplyE-R2dev` target in `SimplifiedR2.workspace` refers to the manually cloned R2 repos):
```bash
./carthage-update-simplye.sh Debug
```
Finally, open the workspace and use the `SimplyE-R2dev` target to build the app.

# Building Secondary Targets

The Xcode project contains 3 additional targets beside the main one referenced earlier:

- **SimplyECardCreator**: This is a convenience target to use when making changes to the [CardCreator-iOS](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/CardCreator-iOS) framework. It takes the framework out of the normal Carthage build to instead build it directly via Xcode. Use this in conjunction with the `SimplifiedCardCreator` workspace.
- **Open eBooks**: This is related to a project currently under development. It is not functional at the moment.
- **SimplyETests**: Suite of unit tests.

# Contributing

This codebase follows Google's  [Swift](https://google.github.io/swift/) and [Objective-C](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml) style guides,
including the use of two-space indentation. More details are available in [our wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Mobile-client-applications#code-style-1).

The primary services/singletons within the program are as follows:

* `AccountsManager`
* `NYPLUserAccount`
* `NYPLBookRegistry`
* `NYPLKeychain`
* `NYPLMyBooksDownloadCenter`
* `NYPLMigrationManager`
* `NYPLSettings`
* `NYPLSettingsNYPLProblemDocumentCacheManager`

Most of the above contain appropriate documentation in the header files.

The rest of the program follows Apple's usual pattern of passive views,
relatively passive models, and one-off controllers for integrating everything.
Immutability is preferred wherever possible.
