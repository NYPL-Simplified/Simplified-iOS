/// This class is a front-end for taking care of situations where an
/// already authenticated user somehow sees its requests fail with a 401
/// HTTP status as it the request lacked proper authentication.
///
/// This typically involves refreshing the authentication token and, depending
/// on the chosen authentication method, opening up a sign-in VC to interact
/// with the user.
///
/// This class takes care of initializing the VC's UI, its business logic,
/// opening up the VC when needed, and performing the log-in request under
/// the hood when no user input is needed.

  /// - Returns: `true` if an authentication flow was started to refresh the
