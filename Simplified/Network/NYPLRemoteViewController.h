/// This class is designed to provide a simple way to implement view controllers that must retreive
/// some sort of network-available data before they can do anything. The idea is that an instance of
/// |NYPLRemoteViewController| can be told to load the data present at some URL. While the data is
/// downloading, it will display a progress indicator. Once the data has been retreived, the handler
/// function provided will be called. That handler then returns a new view controller that is
/// added as a child vc by the instance of |NYPLRemoteViewController|.
///
/// The current left and right bar buttons of the presented view controller, as well as the current
/// title, will be displayed. Changes to said properties later on will not be shown, so be sure they
/// are all set before the handler returns. (Changes to the items already /within/ the left and right
/// sets of items will be correctly displayed, however.)
///
/// For more information, see Apple's documentation on view controller containers.
@interface NYPLRemoteViewController : UIViewController

/// After changing this, you must call |load| to see the effect.
/// For this class to work in a meaningful way, @p URL must be not-nil.

 as a child view controller.
