// via a collection view. It sets up a collection view and handles updating of book cells, but it
// does *not* implement UICollectionViewDataSource and UICollectionViewDelegate methods. Subclasses
// of this class should set the relevant properties of the collection view appropriately to handle
// their unique needs.
