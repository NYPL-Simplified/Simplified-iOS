/// A struct that represents all the keys and some of the fixed values
/// required by the bookmark specification.
///
/// The structure of this type mimics the structure of the spec, as one
/// can see from the [provided examples](https://git.io/JYYFZ).
/// All required keys are listed. When a `value` property is present,
/// it means it's a required fixed value. E.g. the `"type"` key *MUST*
/// have a `"Annotation"` value. Fields that allow more than one
/// fixed value are expressed with enums (e.g. see `Motivation`.)
///
/// Bookmarks created inside the R2 reader *MUST* provide a value for all
/// the keys listed here; exceptions are noted on the individual field.
///
/// Bookmarks created inside the R1 reader *MAY* comply to the same spec
/// and historically some of the key/values overlap, although there has not
/// been consistence in how those bookmarks are defined, especially
/// cross-platform.
///
/// See the [full spec](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-Bookmarks-Spec)
/// for more details.
