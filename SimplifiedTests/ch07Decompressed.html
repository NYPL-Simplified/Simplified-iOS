<p class="noindent"><strong><em>As they followed the train tracks that led back</em></strong> to the bunker, Jack stopped and stared up at a bridge. It towered at least thirty feet above them and in the middle&#8212;in three-feet-high graffitied letters&#8212;were the words URBAN OUTLAWS.</p>
<p class="indent">A major road went over the bridge. Traffic flowed across it day and night.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack shook his head. &#8220;How did you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Slink shrugged. &#8220;Stencils.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Funny. I mean, how did you get up there?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Slink shrugged again. &#8220;Climbed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing him, he hadn&#8217;t used ropes or a harness.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack looked at Charlie. She too seemed impressed. However, it wasn&#8217;t the most intelligent thing to do&#8212;tag the area around the bunker. Sure, go do graffiti&#8212;but somewhere else in London, not so close to home. Slink might as well have painted a big sign with an arrow, <em>Secret bunker this way</em>. Jack considered bringing <a id="page_102"></a>this up with him, but now wasn&#8217;t the time&#8212;a train was coming.</p>
<p class="indent">They jogged into the tunnel, reached a door, and slid through.</p>
<p class="indent">This way to the bunker wasn&#8217;t such a thrill ride. In fact, Wren was humming to herself as they hurried down a flight of concrete stairs and joined the tunnel leading to the bunker.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack stopped at the air lock door and was about to open it when he froze.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Charlie asked.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack motioned for them to listen. There it was again&#8212;a <em>whoosh</em> followed by a deep <em>thunk</em>. He gestured for the others to keep back, opened the door, and peered into the air-lock corridor.</p>
<p class="indent">All was quiet.</p>
<p class="indent">He was about to pull back when the sliding door at the far end opened. Jack braced himself but no one came out. The door hissed shut with a heavy <em>clunk</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He frowned.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Charlie asked.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack was about to respond when the door hissed open and immediately closed again. He pushed the steel door fully open, so the others could see.</p>
<p class="indent">They all watched as the sliding door kept opening and closing. Jack counted off the seconds, but there wasn&#8217;t a pattern to it. As far as he could tell it was totally random. <a id="page_103"></a>He looked at the keypad on the wall. It kept flashing on and off. The only other way to control the door was via Obi&#8217;s computer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Keep this door open,&#8221; Jack said to Charlie, and stepped cautiously into the air-lock corridor. The door hissed open, closed, opened, closed, each time sending a shudder through the floor and walls. &#8220;Obi?&#8221; he said into his headset. No answer. He shouted, &#8220;<em>Obi?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; came the faint reply.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Not me,&#8221; Obi said. &#8220;Security&#8217;s gone nuts.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Can you keep it open long enough for us to get in?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;No control.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack looked at Charlie. &#8220;No control?&#8221; Obi was the master of security. He was always in control.</p>
<p class="indent">The door hissed open, and closed so hard a chunk of plaster fell from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get in there,&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p class="indent">Slink squeezed past. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack grabbed his shoulder. &#8220;If that door closes on you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;I&#8217;ll go <em>squish</em>,&#8221; Slink said with a wry smile. He cracked his knuckles. &#8220;Bring it on.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack released his shoulder and nodded. Slink was no stranger to dangerous situations. The guy was like a cat, but Jack didn&#8217;t dare think about how many of those nine lives he&#8217;d already used up.</p>
<p class="indent">Slink looked intently at the door. &#8220;No pattern?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_104"></a>Jack shook his head. &#8220;None that I can see.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Excellent.&#8221; Slink&#8217;s expression now looked even more determined.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie rolled her eyes but said nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">The door opened, and Slink went to step through but it slammed shut before he had time to react.</p>
<p class="indent">Wren stood in the corner by the other door, wringing her hands. &#8220;Be careful, Slink.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Yeah, yeah,&#8221; Slink said, his focus still on the erratic door as it opened and thudded closed again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got this. Easy.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">The door hissed open. Slink leaped, and three things happened all at once: he spun his body, Wren screamed, and the door slammed shut.</p>
<p class="indent">The door had missed Slink by a couple inches and he&#8217;d made it through.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;You okay?&#8221; Jack shouted. The door hissed open for a second and Slink gave him a thumbs-up.</p>
<p class="indent">Less than a minute later, Slink came back with a chair, and as soon as the door opened he slid it into the gap. The door slammed into the chair, but held open.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack waved Wren over to him. &#8220;You first.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Wren stepped forward, walking stiff and upright, eyes wide, looking nervously at the door. It hissed open for a fraction of a second, then crashed back into the chair. There was a cracking sound.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;You&#8217;ll be okay, just be quick,&#8221; Jack urged her. &#8220;Grab Wren when she comes through,&#8221; he shouted to Slink.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_105"></a>&#8220;No worries.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;You go when I tell you to,&#8221; Jack said to Wren. The door opened, stuttered, and crashed back against the chair. &#8220;<em>Now</em>.&#8221; They helped Wren up, and within a couple of seconds she was inside.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;You next,&#8221; Jack said to Charlie.</p>
<p class="indent">She nodded and braced herself.</p>
<p class="indent">The door opened and banged against the chair again. Jack recoiled as splinters of wood grazed his face. Without waiting a second longer, Charlie leaped over the chair and through the gap.</p>
<p class="indent">The door immediately slammed shut. Then there was another cracking sound, louder this time, and Jack shielded his eyes from more flying splinters. He looked at the chair. It wouldn&#8217;t take another hit. Jack took a quick breath and leaped forward. The door opened, he turned his body in the air, and watched in slow motion as the door started to slide shut again. The chair snapped in the middle, each side shattering into a thousand pieces. Jack cleared the gap and hit the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">He rolled over, taking a moment to gather himself. He was lucky his legs were still in one piece.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie held out her hand and helped him to his feet. The lights inside the bunker were flashing on and off; the LCD monitors around Obi were blinking like crazy. It was pandemonium.</p>
<p class="indent">They rushed over to him.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_106"></a>Obi was panting as if he&#8217;d run a marathon. Sweat poured from his forehead, down his cheeks, and his T-shirt was soaked through. His hands moved fast over keyboards and trackballs. &#8220;It won&#8217;t respond.&#8221; He looked panic-stricken. &#8220;Started ten minutes ago. I&#8217;ve tried everything to stop it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">There was a shudder as the door slammed shut and more plaster cracked and fell from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;First things first,&#8221; Jack said to Charlie, and they hurried down the corridor.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack threw open the first door on the left, and they went inside. The electrical room was small, not much bigger than a broom closet, and crammed full of humming circuit breakers and control gear. Thick bundles of cables crisscrossed the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack stood in front of the server cabinet on the far wall and opened it. This connected the bunker&#8217;s security systems with the computers. If they severed the links, the mayhem would stop.</p>
<p class="indent">His eyes followed the cables but there were at least thirty terminals. &#8220;Which one is it?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Which one is what?&#8221; Charlie said.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack grabbed a gray cable. &#8220;Is this the connection from the server to the bunker&#8217;s controls?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack let go. &#8220;Then which?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie pointed above the cabinet to a set of cables tied <a id="page_107"></a>together. They were as thick as a human arm and terminated in something that looked like a network gateway.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack took a fistful of the cables.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie stopped him. &#8220;Wait, if you disconnect them, we lose everything.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;We&#8217;ve got no choice. If we don&#8217;t do it, the door might jam and we&#8217;ll be stuck down here.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie nudged him aside, reached up, and ran her finger over the cables, muttering to herself.</p>
<p class="indent">There was a thud from the main bunker.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;No time left,&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie disconnected two network cables and the thumping door stopped. &#8220;See?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You gotta be gentle.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack stepped back and breathed a sigh of relief. Then there came a grinding sound. &#8220;<em>What now?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">They ran back into the corridor and stopped to listen. The noise was coming from the generator room, so they went inside.</p>
<p class="indent">In the center sat a large diesel generator, fastened to a concrete plinth by thick steel bolts. The generator itself had a large radiator at one end and, at the other, wide pipes ran to the ceiling&#8212;one carried away the exhaust, the other dragged down oxygen from above.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack looked at the fuel gauge. It was reading half full. That was enough to last them weeks. In the corner of the <a id="page_108"></a>room were five spare fuel tanks and they&#8217;d barely used up the first.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie checked the radiator. It was full of water. Everything was as it should be.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack was about to suggest they go back to the main room when the grinding started again. He turned around. The noise wasn&#8217;t coming from the generator itself, but from the secondary motor that pumped fresh air into the bunker.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie hurried over to it and crouched down. The motor whirred, raced, slowed, then sped up again. She looked at the meter on the side and frowned.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Its power is all over the place,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Is that controlled by the computers as well?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">She nodded.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to disconnect it too.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie stood. &#8220;We could cut power to the whole bunker. Give it a reboot.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;No.&#8221; Jack had a funny feeling that would just cause them a whole lot more trouble. If the computers didn&#8217;t boot back up, then what? Who knew what extra problems they&#8217;d have to face. &#8220;Can you cut all the computer-controlled systems?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Everything?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;<em>Everything</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie nodded. &#8220;Yeah, but it will take me ages just to get the air supply up and running again. I&#8217;ll have to reroute&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_109"></a>&#8220;Go on, do it,&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie hesitated, obviously unsure how long fresh air would last down there. Days? Hours? They had no way to guess.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;We&#8217;ll be fine,&#8221; Jack reassured her, though he wasn&#8217;t so convinced.</p>
<p class="indent">The motor let out a grinding protest as it sped up again. Without any more delay, Charlie hurried back to the control room and a moment later the motor slowed and stopped.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack met her back in the hallway. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s find out what&#8217;s been happening.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">They marched into the main room.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;So,&#8221; Jack said, in as calm a voice as he could muster, &#8220;what&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Obi pointed a shaking finger at one of the screens. It was the one with the code they were copying. &#8220;Like I said, it stopped, right?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack nodded. &#8220;And you said Proteus is working?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Obi nodded. &#8220;Right, so, I was going through the drives, trying to work out where the file had gone&#8221;&#8212;he swallowed&#8212;&#8220;and I found it, <em>here</em>.&#8221; He clicked the trackball, brought up a window full of code, and looked at it. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a virus.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack stared at the screen. &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; he asked, though he could well believe that from what had just happened.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_110"></a>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you,&#8221; Obi said, &#8220;it is a virus. Stupid thing zapped the hardware and caused the computers to start sending all sorts of commands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack leaned in for a closer look. It did seem like some sort of program, but how could it be? The syntax was wrong for a start. He recognized bits of different languages all jumbled together&#8212;Python, C++, Java. Other symbols Jack couldn&#8217;t even identify.</p>
<p class="indent">Scrolling down, he spotted a few lines of code he did understand. The program had infected the security controls and triggered the commands to the door.</p>
<p class="indent">A crease furrowed Jack&#8217;s brow.</p>
<p class="indent">Charlie said, &#8220;What are you thinking?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;As far as I can tell, Obi&#8217;s right&#8212;it&#8217;s a virus, and it&#8217;s probing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Wren said, &#8220;What&#8217;s that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;See here,&#8221; Jack said, indicating the different lines of code. &#8220;It&#8217;s searching for matching language&#8212;it looks like the virus is designed to work out whatever language the newly infected system uses, and cause havoc.&#8221; Jack pulled the keyboard toward him and scrolled through the main code. Parts of the virus were changing, in a permanent state of flux. It was like nothing he&#8217;d ever seen before. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredible,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p class="indent">Several fans sped up as the virus continued to infect the bunker&#8217;s computers.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_111"></a>Obi sat up in his chair. &#8220;We need to kill it.&#8221; He reached for the keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack snatched it away from him. &#8220;Leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;It&#8217;s messing with the bunker.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Not anymore,&#8221; Jack said. &#8220;Charlie isolated it from our security system.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Obi frowned, obviously not convinced. &#8220;It&#8217;s still in our system. What do you want to do with it then?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Jack said. He glanced at the others. They were looking at him like he&#8217;d lost his mind. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just see what it tries to do next.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that risky?&#8221; Charlie said.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack thought the virus was beautiful. He wanted to know how it worked. He admired whoever had designed it. It was a masterpiece. He looked at them all. &#8220;It&#8217;s <em>safe</em>.&#8221; Though he couldn&#8217;t expect them to understand.</p>
<p class="indent">Obi shouted a swearword, which made them all jump.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;What now?&#8221; Slink said.</p>
<p class="indent">Obi pointed at another screen. &#8220;Look.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack shifted position to see.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a satellite image, though fuzzy and tinted green. It showed a bird&#8217;s-eye view of a camp in the middle of a desert. Several tents sat in a circle beside two pickup trucks.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack could just about make out the silhouette of a man leaning against one of the trucks.</p>
<p class="indent">The five of them frowned at the image.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Where&#8217;s that coming from?&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_112"></a>Obi pointed at one of the other screens that showed an open command box linked directly to Proteus.</p>
<p class="indent">For a moment, Jack didn&#8217;t understand, then he remembered. They&#8217;d been so distracted with the virus, they&#8217;d all forgotten the main thing&#8212;that they&#8217;d cured the problem with Proteus.</p>
<p class="indent">From what Jack could tell, Proteus had been infected with that virus, not interference, and somehow, some way, it had moved from Proteus to their own server. Not copied, but actually <em>moved</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Now free, Proteus was running at maximum efficiency, and what Professor Markov had failed to do, they&#8217;d cured by accident.</p>
<p class="indent">But what was Proteus actually doing?</p>
<p class="indent">The image vanished and a document popped up in its place. At the top of the page was the logo and address of the Russian Embassy in London. Below it was a letter typed in what Jack could only assume were Russian symbols.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;I&#8217;m guessing none of you can read that?&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p class="indent">They all shook their heads.</p>
<p class="indent">The image snapped off and was replaced by yet another document. This one had a mug shot of a man with shoulder-length, messy brown hair and a thick beard. He wore a dirty off-white shirt, and his cold, penetrating eyes stared back at them.</p>
<p class="indent">Underneath the man&#8217;s photo was his name: <em>Simon Grate. Age: 37. Wanted in connection with the Manhattan</em> <a id="page_113"></a><em>bank robbery of August 3. Presumed armed and dangerous. Do not approach. Call&#8212;</em></p>
<p class="indent">Before they could finish reading, the image changed to a new satellite photograph&#8212;this one of a densely packed city, though it looked less like a city and more like a shantytown. Thousands of red and gray boxes were packed close together on a hillside.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack thought he recognized it as Caracas, though he wasn&#8217;t sure.</p>
<p class="indent">It was at that exact moment that he got it. &#8220;I know what this is,&#8221; he said, a blast of excitement rising from his stomach. The others looked at him with quizzical expressions. &#8220;Digital secrets.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Digital what now?&#8221; Charlie said.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Secrets.&#8221; Jack pointed at the Proteus display. &#8220;That&#8217;s what it does. Don&#8217;t you get it?&#8221; He couldn&#8217;t believe it. It couldn&#8217;t be real. But there it was.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Wanna explain?&#8221; Slink said, folding his arms and leaning against Obi&#8217;s chair.</p>
<p class="indent">Jack took a deep breath. &#8220;Proteus is a quantum computer, right? Theoretically able to surpass any other computer in the world?&#8221; This was greeted with a mixture of shrugs and nods. &#8220;Well, one use for a quantum computer could be to have it crack any password, gain access to any network.&#8221; He swallowed. &#8220;Take any secret.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Wait, wait,&#8221; Slink said. &#8220;That virus was stopping Proteus from working, and we removed it, so now &#8230; <a id="page_114"></a>what? Proteus is free to steal secrets from all over the world?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Jack nodded and watched as realization dawned on each of their faces. Another document flashed up&#8212;this one a letter with TOP SECRET stamped across it.</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Thanks to us,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;Proteus is now the world&#8217;s best hacker.&#8221;</p>
